This project is a C++ app where you can play the game Tetrix inspired from the famous game Tetris. In addition to the original game, you can play the game with your camera by moving your fists. 
How to play :
While having your hands closed in front of the camera, bump into one another to rotate the piece, move your right hand upper and your left hand lower to move the piece left, and the opposite to move it right.

This project is developed in C++ on Qt 5.10 and the image processing tool used is OpenCV.

In order to make the app work, you need to download Qt5.10 and paste Qt5Cored.dll, Qt5Guid.dll, Qt5Widgetsd.dll in the app folder.
